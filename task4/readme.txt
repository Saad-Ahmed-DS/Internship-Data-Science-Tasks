# 📘 Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts

## 📌 Objective

To estimate medical insurance claim charges based on personal and health-related attributes.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Medical Cost Personal Dataset**
* Includes age, BMI, smoking status, and insurance charges.

## 🛠️ Approach

1. Performed data exploration and correlation analysis.
2. Trained a **Linear Regression** model.
3. Visualized the impact of:

   * Age
   * BMI
   * Smoking status
4. Evaluated model performance using:

   * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## 📈 Results

* The regression model produced reasonable predictions.
* Smoking status had a strong impact on insurance charges.

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Smokers incur significantly higher medical costs.
* Age and BMI are positively correlated with insurance charges.

## ✅ Conclusion

This task provided hands-on experience in regression modeling, visualization, and error-based evaluation metrics.

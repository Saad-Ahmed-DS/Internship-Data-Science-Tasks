# 📘 Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

## 📌 Objective

The objective of this task is to understand how to load, inspect, summarize, and visualize a dataset using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Iris Dataset**
* Contains measurements of iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species.

## 🛠️ Approach

1. Loaded the dataset using **pandas**.
2. Inspected the dataset structure using:

   * `.shape`
   * `.columns`
   * `.head()`
3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
4. Created visualizations:

   * **Scatter plot** to analyze relationships between variables.
   * **Histogram** to study feature distributions.
   * **Box plot** to detect outliers and understand data spread.

## 📈 Visualizations

* Scatter plots reveal clear separability between flower species.
* Histograms show normal and skewed distributions.
* Box plots help identify potential outliers.

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Petal features are more informative than sepal features.
* Setosa species is clearly distinguishable from others.

## ✅ Conclusion

This task helped build a strong foundation in data loading, inspection, and visualization, which is essential for further machine learning tasks.
